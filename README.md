This extension is automatically installed by Kite when you select Visual Studio Code in the list of plugins.

### Startup

When starting VSCode with Kite for the first time, a brief tour about Kite will be displayed in the active pane.

This tour will only be displayed once. If you want to see it again on next startup you can activate the `kite.showTourOnStartup` setting.

### Status Bar

The Kite icon in the status bar displays the state of Kite for the current file. Clicking on the icon will open the status panel with additional information.

The icon in the status bar can take three different colors:

- blue: The Kite Engine is available and functioning properly.<br/>![kite status ready](./docs/images/kite-status-ready.png)
- gray: There’s either no open file or, if there’s an active file, the file is either not supported or not whitelisted.<br/>![kite status not whitelisted](./docs/images/kite-status-non-whitelisted.png)
- red: Something went wrong when the plugin tried to contact the Kite service on your computer. Depending on the issue, the status panel can offer actions to solve the problem.<br/>![kite status not running](./docs/images/kite-status-not-running.png)

### Quick Info

Hovering your mouse over an expression will show you a popup with up to three links:

- `def` will open the file where this symbol is defined (this may not be available if Kite cannot find the definition)
- `docs` will open the sidebar with docs for this expression

### Sidebar

The sidebar offers a more detailed view of an expression. You can use it to browse the members of a module or a type, or to access curated examples, and more.

### Search

Search is available using the corresponding command from the command palette. It will open the search panel on the side.

Type a module, function or symbol name and browse the results in the panel.
